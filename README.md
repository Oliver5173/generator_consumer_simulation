[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zeruniverse/generator_consumer_simulation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zeruniverse/generator_consumer_simulation)    
  
Source code for this assignment is simulation.c  
The hw2 is an executable file compiled from simulation.c (gcc -o hw2 -lpthread simulation.c)  
  
  
#How to use:  
1. Input 1 to run or 2 to set your number of tools & operators  
2. The program then generates threads to simulate this situation and the status will be output to the screen (refresh every 500ms)  
3. Use combination key ctrl+z to pause/resume the program and ctrl+c to terminate the program  
  
  
**IMPORTANT: THIS PROGRAM SHOULD RUN IN FULL-SCREEN COMMAND-LINE-WINDOW to display normally.**  
  
The functions dealing with Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+C to pause/resume/terminate program are written by myself.   
  
Platform: ArchLinux, gcc
